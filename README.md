Answer Booklet: Answers   must   be   typed   into   the   Answer   Booklet   using   Calibri   font   style   of   at   least   size   10.

If   calculations   or   tables   are   required   for   an   answer,   they   should   be   typed,   set   out   neatly   and   labelled   clearly   in   the   Answer   Booklet   in   the   space   provided.   Bullet   point   answers   are   acceptable   only   if   the   whole   sentence   makes sense.   The size of   each box   to answer each question is intended   to be enough to answer the   question,   however,   boxes can   be expanded   if   necessary.
Disciplinary knowledge: The purpose of this assignment is   to be able to demonstrate   an   understanding of the   material covered   in   Modules   1 to 3 and apply appropriate   methods to   solve   problems and explain the   impact   of events on   business   activity.
Solution seeking: For   any   calculation type   questions, you   should   apply   appropriate   problem-   solving   processes   systematically.   Show   all   workings, no matter   how   trivial   as    marks   are   awarded   for   partial work. This   is good   practice for the   exam.

2.       Time value of money: 19 marks Hannah and Alex Thompson   are   preparing to   purchase their first   house and   have   managed to   save   some   money.   However, although they   have these funds, they still   need   to   come   up   with   more   money   to   make   up   15%   of   the   deposit,   which   amounts   to   $25,000.   After   much   discussion   with   their   family,   they   have   come   up with these two   possible options:
Option   1 -   Borrow   money from   Hannah’s   uncle,   Robert.
Option   2 - Alex’s   Mom, Sarah, will take out   a   loan   on   their   behalf.
Ignore any transaction costs and tax involved in buying a house. 
Required: 
(a) Option    1 –      Robert (Hannah’s uncle): Using the relevant interest factor table, calculate the   following   (round your answers to two decimal places):(i)       Hannah’s uncle,   Robert, has   offered to   lend   them the   $25,000   and   he   is   happy for the   loan   and   interest to   be   repaid 8 years   later.   If   Hannah and Alex   borrow the   money from   Robert,   they will   have to   repay the amount of $36,939 (which   includes the principal amount   of the   loan   and   the   interest).   What   rate   of   interest,   compounded   annually,   would   Hannah   and   Alex   be   paying on the 8-year   loan?   How   much   interest would they   have   paid   on the   loan?       (3   marks)
(ii)    If   Robert   asks   Hannah and Alex to   repay the   loan   as   an   annual   equal   amount   at the   end   of   each year over the 8-year   period   based   on the annual   rate   of   interest   calculated   from   a(i),   how   much would the annual   repayment   be? What   is the total cash   repayment for the   loan   over the   period?   How   much   interest would they   have   paid on the   loan?       (4   marks)
(b) Option 2 –   Sarah   (Alex’s   Mom).   Using   the   relevant   interest   factor   table,   calculate   the   following   (round your answers to two decimal places):
(i)       Sarah is willing to borrow the $25,000 from her bank   (East Coast   Bank)   on their   behalf with   an   interest   rate   of   12%   p.a.   compounding   quarterly.   The   loan   and   the   interest   are   to   be   repaid 5 years later. If Sarah borrows the money from the   bank,   how   much will she   pay the   bank   in 5 years’   time?       (2   marks)
(ii)    Sarah decided to find out from another bank (Southwest   Bank) under what conditions they   were   willing   to   lend   the   money   to   her.   If   she   borrowed   $25,000,   they   would   charge   an   interest   rate   of   2%   p.a.   compounded   semi-annually. The   loan   and   interest will   have to   be   repaid   to   the    bank   over   the   5   years   with   equal    payments    needing   to    be    made    at   the beginning of   each   period.   If   Sarah   borrows   the   money   from   this   bank,   what   will   be   the   semi-annual   payments that   she will   make? What   is the   total   cash   repayment   for   the   loan   over the   period?   How   much   interest   would she   have   paid   on the   loan?       (4   marks)
(c)      Based   on   your   answers   to   the   above   questions   for   options   1   and   2,   make   a   recommendation   to   Hannah and Alex as to which   option they   should   choose   and   explain why?       (2   marks,   max 80 words)
(d)   What factors   should   Hannah   and   Alex   consider   before   making   a   decision to take   out   a   mortgage   to   buy their first   home?   Discuss   and   ensure that your   answer   relates to the   current   New Zealand   environment.    (4   marks,   max   100 words)
